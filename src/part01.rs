// Rust-101, Part 01: Expressions, Inherent methods
// ================================================

// For Rust to compile this file, make sure to enable the corresponding line
// in `main.rs` before going on.

//@ Even though our code from the first part works, we can still learn a
//@ lot by making it prettier. That's because Rust is an "expression-based" language, which
//@ means that most of the terms you write down are not just *statements* (executing code), but
//@ *expressions* (returning a value). This applies even to the body of entire functions!

// ## Expression-based programming
//@ For example, consider `sqr`:
fn sqr(i: i32) -> i32 { i * i }
//@ Between the curly braces, we are giving the *expression* that computes the return value.
//@ So we can just write `i * i`, the expression that returns the square if `i`!
//@ This is very close to how mathematicians write down functions (but with more types).

// Conditionals are also just expressions. You can compare this to the ternary `? :` operator
// from languages like C.
fn abs(i: i32) -> i32 { if i >= 0 { i } else { -i } }

//@ And the same applies to case distinction with `match`: Every `arm` of the match
//@ gives the expression that is returned in the respective case.
//@ (We repeat the definition from the previous part here.)
enum NumberOrNothing {
    Number(i32),
    Nothing
}
use self::NumberOrNothing::{Number,Nothing};
fn number_or_default(n: NumberOrNothing, default: i32) -> i32 {
    match n {
        Nothing => default,
        Number(n) => n,
    }
}

// It is even the case that blocks are expressions, evaluating to the last expression they contain.
fn compute_stuff(x: i32) -> i32 {
    let y = { let z = x*x; z + 14 };
    y*y
}

// Let us now refactor `vec_min`.
fn vec_min(v: Vec<i32>) -> NumberOrNothing {
    //@ Remember that helper function `min_i32`? Rust allows us to define such helper functions *inside* other
    //@ functions. This is just a matter of namespacing, the inner function has no access to the data of the outer
    //@ one. Still, being able to nicely group functions can be very useful.
    fn min_i32(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
        if a < b { a } else { b }                                   /*@*/
    }

    let mut min = Nothing;
    for e in v {
        //@ Notice that all we do here is compute a new value for `min`, and that it will always end
        //@ up being a `Number` rather than `Nothing`. In Rust, the structure of the code
        //@ can express this uniformity.
        min = Number(match min {                                    /*@*/
            Nothing => e,                                           /*@*/
            Number(n) => min_i32(n, e)                              /*@*/
        });                                                         /*@*/
    }
    //@ The `return` keyword exists in Rust, but it is rarely used. Instead, we typically
    //@ make use of the fact that the entire function body is an expression, so we can just
    //@ write down the desired return value.
    min
}

// Now that's already much shorter! Make sure you can go over the code above and actually understand
// every step of what's going on.

// ## Inherent implementations
//@ So much for `vec_min`. Let us now reconsider `print_number_or_nothing`. That function
//@ really belongs pretty close to the type `NumberOrNothing`. In C++ or Java, you would
//@ probably make it a method of the type. In Rust, we can achieve something very similar
//@ by providing an *inherent implementation*.
impl NumberOrNothing {
    fn print(self) {
        match self {
            Nothing => println!("The number is: <nothing>"),
            Number(n) => println!("The number is: {}", n),
        };
    }
}
//@ So, what just happened? Rust separates code from data, so the definition of the
//@ methods on an `enum` (and also on `struct`, which we will learn about later)
//@ is independent of the definition of the type. `self` is like `this` in other
//@ languages, and its type is always implicit. So `print` is now a method that
//@ takes as first argument a `NumberOrNothing`, just like `print_number_or_nothing`.
//@
//@ Try making `number_or_default` from above an inherent method as well!

// With our refactored functions and methods, `main` now looks as follows:
fn read_vec() -> Vec<i32> {
    vec![18,5,7,2,9,27]
}
pub fn main() {
    let vec = read_vec();
    let min = vec_min(vec);
    min.print();                                                    /*@*/
}
// You will have to replace `part00` by `part01` in the `main` function in
// `main.rs` to run this code.

// **Exercise 01.1**: Write a funtion `vec_sum` that computes the sum of all values of a `Vec<i32>`.
fn vec_sum(vec: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    let mut sum = 0;

    for n in vec {
        sum += n;
    }

    sum
}

// **Exercise 01.2**: Write a function `vec_print` that takes a vector and prints all its elements.
fn vec_print(vec: Vec<i32>) {
    for e in vec {
        println!("{}", e);
    }
}
